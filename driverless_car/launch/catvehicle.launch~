This launch file loads the worlds and models for the catvehicle

How to execute it:
=================

<rosparam param="/use_sim_time">true</rosparam>

<node name="urdf_spawner" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" respawn="false" output="screen"
args="-x 0 -y 0 -Y 0 -urdf -model sak -param robot_description"/>


<!-- Load joint controller configurations from YAML file to parameter server -->
  <rosparam file="$(find driverless_car)/config/$(arg config_file)" command="load" ns="sak"/>
 <!-- <param name="tf_prefix" value="$(arg robot_name)"/>-->

<!-- load the controllers -->
